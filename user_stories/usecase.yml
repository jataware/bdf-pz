# BUG NOTE: sequence of actions:
# 1. Run the first query in the 'default' context
# 2. Switch to the 'palimpzest' context
# 3. Reset the kernel
# 4. Rerun the first query, the agent is not able to pick the correct tools.
# Is this intended behavior? It would work if 2. and 3. are swapped.

# Run the following command once to set the input dataset:
# pz reg --path testdata/bdf-demo --name bdf-demo
{
  "User": "I have a dataset of scientific papers and I want to only consider the ones published from 2021 onwards. And from these papers, extract the title and authors."
} 
# The agent parses a filter, but it stops after the first operation.

{
  "User": "Is that it?"
  }
# This prompts the agent to run the tools to convert and run the workload.

# The output of the execution is the following. It misses 2 papers but the 3 included are correct.
# authors title
# 0,Zhengke Li, ATR prevents Ca2+ overload-induced necrotic ce...
# 1,Carolina Marques, NF1 regulates mesenchymal glioblastoma plastic...
# 2,A list of authors..., Single-nuclei and bulk-tissue gene-expression ...

{
  "User": "What if I want to also include the papers from 2020?"
}
# The agent parses this as a filter on the year, but the result will be incorrect because of two reasons:
# 1. The filter is applied on the converted dataset that only includes author/title of publication
# 2. The flter is applied on the already filtered dataset, so the result will not include any more papers.

{
  "User": "Is that it?"
}
# This fires another convert and execute cycle whic ultimately leads to an empty result.
