The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a proteogenomic study on colon cancer, which involves analyzing proteins and phosphoproteins in tumor and normal tissues. It mentions the identification of cancer-associated proteins, phosphosites, biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. The study also highlights the association of Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, suggesting a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation. Additionally, it identifies a link between decreased CD8 T cell infiltration and increased glycolysis in MSI-H tumors, suggesting glycolysis as a potential target to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. The context is focused on the proteogenomic analysis of human colon cancer and its implications for therapeutic opportunities.
