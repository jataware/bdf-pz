The text contents of the PDF mention several genes in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). The study identifies four critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play a pivotal role in the development of CRC. These genes are CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. The context in which these genes are mentioned is related to their role as biomarkers for colorectal cancer, with a focus on their potential for precision oncology and personalized risk assessment. The disease associated with these genes is colorectal cancer.

Notably, PSMC2 and CXCL8 appear to play a central role in CRC, and CXCL8 alone could potentially serve as an early-stage marker for CRC."

list indices must be integers or slices, not str
