The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a proteogenomic study on human colon cancer, which involves analyzing proteins and phosphoproteins in tumor and normal tissues. The study aims to identify cancer-associated proteins, biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. It also explores the relationship between Rb phosphorylation and cancer proliferation, as well as the association between CD8 T cell infiltration and glycolysis in MSI-H tumors. The context is related to the study of colorectal cancer, its molecular heterogeneity, and potential therapeutic targets.
