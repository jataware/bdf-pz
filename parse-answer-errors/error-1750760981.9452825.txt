The text contents of the PDF mention a study that identifies four critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for colorectal cancer (CRC). These genes are listed as CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. The context specifically highlights these genes as having the highest accuracy in detecting CRC and notes their potential roles in CRC development and diagnosis. Therefore, the gene names mentioned in the paper are CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1.

ANSWER:
```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "CXCL8"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "PSMC2"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "APP"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "SLC20A1"
  }
]
```
