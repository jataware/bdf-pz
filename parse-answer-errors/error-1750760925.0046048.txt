The text contents of the PDF mention a study that identifies four critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for colorectal cancer (CRC). These genes are listed as CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. The task is to extract the name of the gene mentioned in the paper. Since the context provides a list of four genes, we will include all of them in the output.

ANSWER:
```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "CXCL8"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "PSMC2"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "APP"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "SLC20A1"
  }
]
```
