The context provided is a text excerpt from a scientific paper titled "Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities" by Suhas Vasaikar and others. The text discusses various aspects of colon cancer research, including proteogenomic studies, phosphoproteomics, and potential therapeutic targets. The text mentions several proteins and genes in the context of cancer research, such as Rb phosphorylation and CD8 T cell infiltration, but it does not explicitly mention a specific gene name as the main focus of the paper.

However, the text does mention "Rb phosphorylation" in the context of colon cancer, which refers to the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). This is a well-known gene involved in cell cycle regulation and is often studied in cancer research. Therefore, the gene name that can be derived from the text is "Rb" (retinoblastoma).

  {
    "gene_name": "Rb"
  }
]
