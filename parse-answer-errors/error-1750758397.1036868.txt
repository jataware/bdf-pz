To determine the gene name mentioned in the text, we need to carefully examine the provided text contents for any specific gene names. The text contents describe a proteogenomic study on colon cancer, mentioning various proteins, pathways, and potential therapeutic targets. 

Upon reviewing the text, we find that the text mentions "Rb phosphorylation" in the context of colon cancer. "Rb" refers to the retinoblastoma protein, which is encoded by the RB1 gene. This is the only specific gene name mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the gene name mentioned in the text is "RB1".
