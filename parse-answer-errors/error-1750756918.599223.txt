The text contents of the PDF provide information about a study focused on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study identifies four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. These genes are highlighted as having significant roles in the detection and understanding of CRC. The disease mentioned in the context is colorectal cancer. Therefore, we can extract the following information:

1. **Gene Name**: The genes mentioned in the study are CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1.
2. **Disease**: The disease associated with these genes is colorectal cancer.
3. **Context**: The context information regarding the gene mention is that these genes are identified as critical DEGs in the study for colorectal cancer, with CXCL8 and PSMC2 playing central roles.

Based on this reasoning, we can generate the JSON object as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "CXCL8",
    "disease": "colorectal cancer",
    "context": "Identified as a critical DEG in the study for colorectal cancer, potentially serving as an early-stage marker."
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "PSMC2",
    "disease": "colorectal cancer",
    "context": "Identified as a critical DEG in the study for colorectal cancer, playing a central role."
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "APP",
    "disease": "colorectal cancer",
    "context": "Identified as a critical DEG in the study for colorectal cancer."
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "SLC20A1",
    "disease": "colorectal cancer",
    "context": "Identified as a critical DEG in the study for colorectal cancer."
  }
]
