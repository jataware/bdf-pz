The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a study aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play a pivotal role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The study discovered four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1, which exhibit high accuracy in detecting CRC. The context in which these genes are mentioned is related to their role as biomarkers for CRC and their potential use in precision oncology for personalized risk assessment and treatment plans.

    "context": "The study discovered a set of four critical DEGs - CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1 - that exhibit the highest accuracy in detecting CRC in diverse populations and ethnicities. Notably, PSMC2 and CXCL8 appear to play a central role in CRC, and CXCL8 alone could potentially serve as an early-stage marker for CRC. This work represents a pioneering effort in applying the max-logistic competing risk factor model to identify critical genes for human malignancies, and the interpretability and reproducibility of the results across diverse populations suggests that the four DEGs identified can provide a comprehensive description of the transcriptomic features of CRC."
