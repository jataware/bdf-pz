The context provided is a text excerpt from a scientific paper titled "Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities" by Suhas Vasaikar and others. The text discusses various aspects of colon cancer research, including proteogenomic studies, phosphoproteomics, and potential therapeutic targets. The text mentions several proteins and pathways, but we need to identify the specific gene name mentioned in the paper.

Upon reviewing the text, we find that the gene "Rb" is mentioned in the context of phosphorylation associated with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer. This suggests that "Rb" is a gene of interest in the study.

Therefore, the gene name mentioned in the paper is "Rb".

ANSWER:
```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "Rb"
  }
]
```
