The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a proteogenomic study on colon cancer, focusing on the analysis of tumor and normal tissues to identify cancer-associated proteins and phosphosites. It highlights the integration of proteogenomics to prioritize targets and novel findings, such as the association of Rb phosphorylation with colon cancer proliferation and the potential targeting of glycolysis in MSI-H tumors. The study aims to provide new therapeutic opportunities and insights into colorectal cancer.
