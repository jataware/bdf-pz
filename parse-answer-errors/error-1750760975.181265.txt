The context provided in the text_contents field of the input describes a study focused on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study identifies four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. Among these, CXCL8 and PSMC2 are highlighted as playing a central role in CRC, with CXCL8 potentially serving as an early-stage marker for CRC. The disease associated with these genes is colorectal cancer, as mentioned multiple times throughout the text. The context in which the gene is mentioned is the study's goal to identify DEGs that play a pivotal role in the development of CRC using a machine-learning framework.
