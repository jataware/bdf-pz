The text contents of the PDF file "vasaikar2019.pdf" provide information about a proteogenomic study on colon cancer. The study is described as a proteogenomic analysis of human colon cancer, which reveals new therapeutic opportunities. The text mentions that the study was conducted on a cohort of colon cancer patients and discusses various aspects of the disease, including proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis, biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer/testis antigens. The text also highlights the association of Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, as well as the potential targeting of glycolysis in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors.

Based on this information, the disease associated with the gene in the context of this study is colon cancer.
