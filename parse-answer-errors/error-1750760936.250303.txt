The context provided is a text excerpt from a scientific paper titled "Proteogenomic Analysis of Human Colon Cancer Reveals New Therapeutic Opportunities" by Suhas Vasaikar and colleagues. The text discusses various aspects of the study, including proteogenomic integration, phosphoproteomics, and potential therapeutic targets in colon cancer. The text mentions several proteins and pathways, but the specific mention of a gene name is not directly evident in the provided text. However, the text does mention "Rb phosphorylation" and "CD8 T cell infiltration," which are related to genes/proteins involved in cancer biology. The gene name "Rb" refers to the retinoblastoma protein, which is encoded by the RB1 gene. Therefore, the gene name mentioned in the paper is "RB1."

ANSWER:
