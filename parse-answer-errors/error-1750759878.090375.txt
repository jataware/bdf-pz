The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a study aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play a pivotal role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The study discovered four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1, which exhibit high accuracy in detecting CRC. The context of the gene mentions its role in CRC detection and its potential as a biomarker for early-stage CRC. Therefore, the context in which the gene is mentioned is related to its identification as a critical DEG for CRC and its potential use in precision oncology.

    "context": "The study discovered a set of four critical DEGs - CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1 - that exhibit the highest accuracy in detecting CRC in diverse populations and ethnicities. Notably, PSMC2 and CXCL8 appear to play a central role in CRC, and CXCL8 alone could potentially serve as an early-stage marker for CRC."
