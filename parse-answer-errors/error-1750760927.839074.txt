The context provided is from a scientific paper discussing a proteogenomic study on colon cancer. We need to extract the gene name, the disease associated with the gene, and the context in which the gene is mentioned.

1. **Gene Name**: The text mentions "Rb phosphorylation" in the context of colon cancer. "Rb" refers to the retinoblastoma protein, which is a well-known gene/protein involved in cancer biology.

2. **Disease**: The disease mentioned in the text is "colon cancer," which is also referred to as "colorectal cancer (CRC)" in the introduction.

3. **Context**: The context in which the gene is mentioned is related to its phosphorylation and its association with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer. This suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer.

Based on this information, we can construct the JSON object as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "Rb",
    "disease": "colon cancer",
    "context": "Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer."
  }
]
```
