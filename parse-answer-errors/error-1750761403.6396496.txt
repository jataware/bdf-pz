  "gene_description": "The NF1 gene is described as a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway. It plays a crucial role in glioblastoma by modulating the expression of FOSL1, which is a key regulator of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. The loss or mutation of NF1 is associated with increased RAS/MAPK activity, leading to enhanced expression of FOSL1, which in turn contributes to the plasticity and aggressiveness of mesenchymal glioblastoma. This gene is significant in the context of glioblastoma as its alterations are linked to the mesenchymal subtype, which is characterized by worse survival rates and increased tumor aggressiveness.",
