The context in which the gene is mentioned can be derived from the text contents of the PDF. The text discusses a study on colorectal cancer (CRC) and the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play a pivotal role in CRC development. Specifically, the study identifies four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. These genes are highlighted for their potential as biomarkers for CRC, with CXCL8 noted for its potential as an early-stage marker. The context of the gene mentions its role in CRC detection and its significance in the study's findings.

    "context": "The study discovered a set of four critical DEGs - CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1 - that exhibit the highest accuracy in detecting CRC in diverse populations and ethnicities. Notably, PSMC2 and CXCL8 appear to play a central role in CRC, and CXCL8 alone could potentially serve as an early-stage marker for CRC."
