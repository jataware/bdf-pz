The text contents of the PDF mention a set of four critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified in the study. These genes are CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1. The task is to extract the name of the gene mentioned in the text. Since the context provides a list of these genes, we can include each of them as separate entries in the JSON list.

ANSWER:
```json
[
  {
    "gene_name": "CXCL8"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "PSMC2"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "APP"
  },
  {
    "gene_name": "SLC20A1"
  }
]
```

list indices must be integers or slices, not str
