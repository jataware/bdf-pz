To generate the JSON object, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided context. The context includes a text passage from a scientific paper, and we need to identify the gene name, the associated disease, and the context information regarding the gene mention.

1. **Gene Name**: The text mentions "Rb phosphorylation" and "CD8 T cell infiltration" in the context of colon cancer. However, "Rb" (Retinoblastoma protein) is a well-known gene/protein, and it is specifically mentioned in relation to phosphorylation and its role in colon cancer. Therefore, the gene name is "Rb".

2. **Disease**: The text is focused on "colon cancer" and "colorectal cancer (CRC)". These terms are used interchangeably in the context of the study. Therefore, the disease associated with the gene is "colon cancer".

3. **Context**: The context regarding the gene mention is that "Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer."

Now, we can construct the JSON object with the extracted information:

```json
[
  {
    "context": "Phosphoproteomics data associated Rb phosphorylation with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in colon cancer, which explains why this classical tumor suppressor is amplified in colon tumors and suggests a rationale for targeting Rb phosphorylation in colon cancer.",
    "disease": "colon cancer",
    "gene_name": "Rb"
  }
]
```
