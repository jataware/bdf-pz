The context provided is a detailed description of a study focused on identifying critical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study uses a machine-learning framework to identify genes that serve as biomarkers for CRC. The text mentions several genes, but the focus is on four critical DEGs: CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1, which are identified as having the highest accuracy in detecting CRC. The disease associated with these genes, as repeatedly mentioned throughout the text, is colorectal cancer (CRC).
